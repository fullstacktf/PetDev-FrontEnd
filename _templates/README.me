# Hygen approach for testing components and views
Hygen is a generator code by templating. 

For this approach we create some boilerplate code on test. 

Simple test for render checks with the testing libraries.

## Examples and first demos
```
hygen tester new --path ./src/components --subpath containers --name TexContainer
```
In the first generation all the test must pass. :green: It's our task give some more complex case of use for fail and improve the code later.

Good Luck !
